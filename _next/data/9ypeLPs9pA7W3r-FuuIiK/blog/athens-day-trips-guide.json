Complete guide with travel times, what to expect, and how to choose.","content":"\n![Cape Sounion Temple of Poseidon at sunset](/assets/images/sounion-sunset.webp)\n\nAthens is extraordinary, but the real magic of Greece isn't contained within the city limits. Just an hour or two away from central Athens—sometimes less—you'll find ancient temples overlooking the Aegean, island towns where time moves differently, thermal spas where Greeks go to decompress, and fishing villages where your biggest decision is which taverna to choose for lunch. These aren't resort destinations or overly polished tourist traps. They're the kind of places Athenians actually escape to on weekends.\n\n---\n\n## Cape Sounion\n\n### Best for sunset views and dramatic landscapes\n\n**Travel time:** About 1 to 1.5 hours by car from central Athens\n\nCape Sounion is home to the Temple of Poseidon, perched dramatically above the Aegean Sea. The coastal drive alone justifies the trip—you'll follow the Athens Riviera with the sea constantly in view, passing beaches and rocky outcrops that make you want to pull over every few minutes.\n\nThe temple itself is smaller than you might expect, but that's part of its charm. Those weathered Doric columns standing against the sky have been there since 444 BC, and you can still see Byron's name carved into one of them (don't follow his example).\n\nMost people come for sunset, and honestly, they're right to. When the light goes golden and the tour buses have mostly cleared out, the place feels almost sacred. Get there about 90 minutes before sunset to explore properly and claim a good spot. Last entry is typically 30 minutes before closing, so don't cut it too close.\n\n---\n\n## Aegina Island\n\n### Best for island vibes without long travel\n\n**Travel time:** 40 to 75 minutes by ferry from Piraeus, depending on the boat\n\nAegina delivers proper Greek island atmosphere despite being a short ferry ride from Athens. The port town has that relaxed island energy—narrow streets, waterfront cafes, locals who actually seem happy to see tourists. You can swim at organized beaches, explore the Temple of Aphaia (genuinely one of Greece's best-preserved ancient temples), or just wander around eating pistachios.\n\nThe pistachios are everywhere, and they're legitimately better than what you'll find on the mainland. Pistachio ice cream, pistachio pastries, bags of roasted pistachios at every corner. It's the island's thing, and locals take it seriously.\n\nFor lunch, pick any taverna along the harbor. Fresh seafood, cold beer, water lapping at the dock—this is what people picture when they think \"Greek island.\"\n\nTake the fast ferry (Flying Cat or similar) if you can. Forty minutes beats an hour-plus on the regular boat, especially if you're prone to seasickness. Book tickets through [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com) to compare times and prices.\n\n---\n\n## Chalkida (Evia Island)\n\n### Best for something different and local\n\n**Travel time:** About 1 hour by car or train\n\nChalkida sits just across a bridge from the mainland, connected by the narrowest strait you've ever seen. The Euripus Strait is famous for its weird tidal behavior—the water reverses direction multiple times a day, and nobody fully understands why. Ancient Greeks noticed it, modern scientists study it, and tourists stand on the bridge watching the current change like they're witnessing magic.\n\nThe town itself feels genuinely Greek rather than tourist-ready. Locals fill the waterfront cafes, seafood tavernas serve whatever came in that morning, and the promenade stretches for what feels like miles. You won't find souvenir shops every ten feet or menus translated into eight languages. This is where Athenians come when they want to escape other Athenians.\n\nAsk someone at a cafe when the tide changes next—it happens roughly every six hours, give or take. Watching the strait reverse itself is oddly mesmerizing.\n\n---\n\n## Loutraki\n\n### Best for spa vibes and seaside walks\n\n**Travel time:** About 1 to 1.5 hours by car or bus\n\n**What to expect:**\n\nLoutraki is known for its **natural mineral springs** and long beachfront. You can enjoy a swim, walk along the promenade, or visit a spa for thermal treatments.\n\nThe town has a classic resort feel, with cafés facing the sea and easy access to nearby attractions like **Lake Vouliagmeni** (the Corinthian one) or the **Corinth Canal**.\n\n**What kind of experience it is:**\n\nRelaxing and low-effort. Ideal if you want a wellness-style day with minimal planning.\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Combine Loutraki with a quick stop at the **Corinth Canal** (15 minutes away) for dramatic photos of the narrow waterway carved through solid rock.\n\n---\n\n## Porto Rafti\n\n### Best for a quick beach escape close to Athens\n\n**Travel time:** About 45 minutes by car\n\nPorto Rafti is where Athenians go when they want beach time without the commitment of a full island trip. It's a coastal town with organized beaches, smaller coves if you explore a bit, and enough tavernas lining the water that you can pick one at random and eat well.\n\nThere's no ancient site to visit, no museum to check off your list. The entire point is sea, food, and doing very little. Swim, dry off, eat grilled fish, repeat. Summer weekends get packed with families from Athens, so weekdays are your friend if you prefer space and quieter tavernas.\n\n---\n\n## ⚔️ Marathonas, Zouberi, and Nea Makri\n\n### Best for combining history and the sea\n\n**Travel time:** 45 minutes to 1 hour by car\n\n**What to expect:**\n\nThis area blends historical importance with coastal life. You can visit the site of the **Battle of Marathon** and the **Marathon Tomb**, then head to the nearby beaches of **Zouberi** or **Nea Makri** for swimming and food.\n\nNea Makri in particular has a long seaside road full of tavernas and cafés, making it easy to end the day with a relaxed meal by the sea.\n\n**What kind of experience it is:**\n\nBalanced and flexible. A good mix of culture, beach time, and local dining.\n\n**💡 Local tip:** The **Archaeological Museum of Marathon** is small but excellent. Spend 30-45 minutes there before heading to the beach.\n\n---\n\n## How to Choose the Right Day Trip from Athens\n\n| Priority | Best Destination |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| **History and views** | Cape Sounion |\n| **Island feel** | Aegina |\n| **Local atmosphere** | Chalkida |\n| **Relaxation and wellness** | Loutraki |\n| **Beaches close to the city** | Porto Rafti |\n| **History plus seaside** | Marathonas, Zouberi, Nea Makri |\n\n---\n\n## Practical Tips for Day Trips\n\n### Transportation\n\nRent a car for Cape Sounion, Loutraki, or Porto Rafti—you'll want the flexibility to stop along the coast. Ferries are essential for Aegina and run frequently from Piraeus port. Trains and buses work fine for Chalkida and Loutraki if you're on a budget.\n\n### Timing\n\nLeave Athens between 8:00 and 9:00 AM to beat traffic and maximize your day. Check ferry schedules beforehand if you're heading to Aegina. For Cape Sounion sunset tours, book ahead during summer—those tours fill up.\n\nWeekdays beat weekends for beach destinations unless you enjoy crowds and inflated taverna prices.\n\n### What to Bring\n\nSunscreen and a hat—Greek sun doesn't care what month it is. Water bottle for archaeological sites where shade is a myth. Comfortable shoes because ancient marble and modern cobblestones both hate your feet. Download offline Google Maps for coastal areas where cell signal gets patchy.\n\n---\n\n## Make the Most of It\n\nAthens works as more than just a city destination—it's a launching point for completely different experiences within an hour or two. One extra day gives you ancient temples at sunset, proper island vibes, or coastal towns where you can actually relax.\n\nMost of these destinations work year-round, though you'll want to check ferry schedules in winter for Aegina. If you're timing coastal trips, our [Athens weather guide](/blog/greece-weather-swimming-ferry-guide) helps you pick the right months. Flying in or out the same day? The [Athens airport transport guide](/blog/athens-airport-to-city-guide) covers timing and logistics.\n\nFor curated maps with hidden beaches, authentic tavernas, and routes that skip the traffic, visit [googlementor.com](https://googlementor.com). The local spots are always better than whatever TripAdvisor suggests.\n\n---\n\n### Useful Resources\n\n- **Ferry bookings:** [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com)\n- **Car rentals:** Available at Athens Airport and city center\n- **Bus schedules:** [KTEL Attica](https://www.ktelattikis.gr)\n- **Train info:** [TrainOSE](https://www.trainose.gr)\n","language":"en","tags":["Athens","Day Trips","Greece","Travel Guide","Islands","Beaches"]},"mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = {\n    a: \"a\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    hr: \"hr\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    table: \"table\",\n    tbody: \"tbody\",\n    td: \"td\",\n    th: \"th\",\n    thead: \"thead\",\n    tr: \"tr\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    ..._provideComponents(),\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.img, {\n        src: \"/assets/images/sounion-sunset.webp\",\n        alt: \"Cape Sounion Temple of Poseidon at sunset\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Athens is extraordinary, but the real magic of Greece isn't contained within the city limits.

Πλήρης οδηγός με χρόνους διαδρομής, τι να περιμένετε και πώς να επιλέξετε.","content":"\n![Ναός του Ποσειδώνα στο Σούνιο κατά το ηλιοβασίλεμα](/assets/images/sounion-sunset.webp)\n\nΗ Αθήνα είναι μια απίστευτη πόλη, αλλά η πραγματική μαγεία της Ελλάδας δεν περιέχεται μόνο στα όρια της πόλης. Μόλις μια ώρα ή δύο μακριά από το κέντρο της Αθήνας—μερικές φορές λιγότερο—θα βρείτε αρχαίους ναούς που κοιτάζουν το Αιγαίο, νησιώτικες πόλεις όπου ο χρόνος κυλά διαφορετικά, ιαματικά λουτρά όπου οι Αθηναίοι πηγαίνουν να χαλαρώσουν και ψαροχώρια όπου η μεγαλύτερη απόφασή σας είναι ποια ταβέρνα να διαλέξετε για μεσημέρι. Αυτά δεν είναι resort ή υπερβολικά γυαλιστερές τουριστικές παγίδες. Αυτά είναι τα μέρη που οι Αθηναίοι πραγματικά φεύγουν τα Σαββατοκύριακα.\n\n---\n\n## Σούνιο\n\n### Καλύτερο για θέα ηλιοβασιλέματος και δραματικά τοπία\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** Περίπου 1 έως 1,5 ώρα με αυτοκίνητο από το κέντρο της Αθήνας\n\nΤο Σούνιο φιλοξενεί τον Ναό του Ποσειδώνα, σκαρφαλωμένο δραματικά πάνω από το Αιγαίο Πέλαγος. Η παράκτια διαδρομή από μόνη της δικαιολογεί το ταξίδι—θα ακολουθήσετε την Αθηναϊκή Ριβιέρα με τη θάλασσα συνεχώς στο οπτικό σας πεδίο, περνώντας παραλίες και βραχώδεις προεξοχές που σας κάνουν να θέλετε να τραβήξετε στην άκρη κάθε λίγα λεπτά.\n\nΟ ίδιος ο ναός είναι μικρότερος από ό,τι θα περιμένατε, αλλά αυτό είναι μέρος της γοητείας του. Αυτές οι ξεπερασμένες δωρικές κολόνες που στέκονται ενάντια στον ουρανό είναι εκεί από το 444 π.Χ., και μπορείτε ακόμα να δείτε το όνομα του Byron χαραγμένο σε μία από αυτές (μην ακολουθήσετε το παράδειγμά του).\n\nΟι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι έρχονται για το ηλιοβασίλεμα, και ειλικρινά, έχουν δίκιο που το κάνουν. Όταν το φως γίνεται χρυσαφένιο και τα τουριστικά λεωφορεία έχουν φύγει περισσότερο, το μέρος αισθάνεται σχεδόν ιερό. Φτάστε περίπου 90 λεπτά πριν από το ηλιοβασίλεμα για να εξερευνήσετε σωστά και να διεκδικήσετε ένα καλό σημείο. Η τελευταία είσοδος είναι συνήθως 30 λεπτά πριν το κλείσιμο, οπότε μην το κόψετε πολύ κοντά.\n\n---\n\n## Αίγινα\n\n### Καλύτερο για νησιώτικη ατμόσφαιρα χωρίς μεγάλο ταξίδι\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** 40 έως 75 λεπτά με πλοίο από τον Πειραιά, ανάλογα με το πλοίο\n\nΗ Αίγινα αισθάνεται σαν αληθινό ελληνικό νησί, παρόλο που είναι πολύ κοντά στην Αθήνα. Περιπατήστε γύρω από την πόλη του λιμανιού, κολυμπήστε σε κοντινές παραλίες, ή επισκεφθείτε τον Ναό της Αφαίας—έναν από τους καλύτερα διατηρημένους αρχαίους ναούς της Ελλάδας που οι περισσότεροι τουρίστες παραλείπουν εντελώς.\n\nΤα φιστίκια είναι παντού. Δεν εννοώ \"διάσημα για φιστίκια\" με τον τρόπο που οι οδηγοί ταξιδιών το λένε—εννοώ ότι οι ντόπιοι το παίρνουν σοβαρά. Παγωτό φιστίκι, γλυκά φιστίκια, πλασέ πλαστικές σακούλες με φιστίκια που πωλούνται από πλανόδιους πωλητές δίπλα στο λιμάνι. Αγοράστε μερικά πριν φύγετε—είναι πραγματικά καλύτερα από οτιδήποτε θα βρείτε στην Αθήνα.\n\nΤο μεσημεριανό δίπλα στη θάλασσα είναι εύκολο και χαλαρό, με ταβέρνες να στολίζουν το λιμάνι. Αυτή είναι μια κλασική νησιώτικη μέρα—πλοία, παραλίες, θαλασσινά—χωρίς τη δέσμευση διανυκτέρευσης. Πάρτε το γρήγορο πλοίο (Flying Cat ή παρόμοιο) για ταξίδι 40 λεπτών. Κλείστε εισιτήρια στο Ferryhopper για να συγκρίνετε δρομολόγια και τιμές.\n\n---\n\n## Χαλκίδα (Εύβοια)\n\n### Καλύτερο για κάτι διαφορετικό και τοπικό\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** Περίπου 1 ώρα με αυτοκίνητο ή τρένο\n\nΗ Χαλκίδα συνδέεται με την ηπειρωτική Ελλάδα με γέφυρα και είναι γνωστή για το παράξενο φαινόμενο των παλιρροιών στον Ευριπο, όπου το νερό αλλάζει κατεύθυνση αρκετές φορές τη μέρα. Κανείς δεν το καταλαβαίνει πλήρως γιατί—έχουν ακόμα επιστήμονες που το μελετούν αιώνες αργότερα. Οι ντόπιοι στέκονται και το παρακολουθούν, ειδικά όταν το ρεύμα αλλάζει. Ρωτήστε για τις ώρες αλλαγής της παλίρροιας (συμβαίνει περίπου κάθε 6 ώρες)—το να παρακολουθείτε το νερό να αντιστρέφει κατεύθυνση είναι πραγματικά συναρπαστικό.\n\nΗ ίδια η πόλη είναι ζωντανή και πολύ ελληνική. Καφετέριες, ψαροταβέρνες και μια μακριά παραθαλάσσια προκυμαία όπου οι Αθηναίοι πραγματικά έρχονται τα Σαββατοκύριακα. Λιγότερο τουριστική από άλλους προορισμούς, γεγονός που σημαίνει ότι είναι αυθεντική, χαλαρή, και κανείς δεν προσπαθεί να σας πουλήσει κάτι που δεν χρειάζεστε.\n\n---\n\n## Λουτράκι\n\n### Καλύτερο για spa ατμόσφαιρα και παραθαλάσσιους περιπάτους\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** Περίπου 1 έως 1,5 ώρα με αυτοκίνητο ή λεωφορείο\n\nΤο Λουτράκι είναι γνωστό για τις φυσικές ορυκτές πηγές του και την μακριά παραλία. Απολαύστε κολύμπι, περπατήστε κατά μήκος της προκυμαίας, ή επισκεφθείτε ένα spa για θερμικές θεραπείες. Η πόλη έχει μια κλασική θεραπευτική αίσθηση—καφετέριες με θέα στη θάλασσα, χαλαρή ατμόσφαιρα, κανένα δράμα.\n\nΕύκολη πρόσβαση σε κοντινά αξιοθέατα όπως η Λίμνη Βουλιαγμένης (η Κορινθιακή) ή η Διώρυγα της Κορίνθου. Στην πραγματικότητα, συνδυάστε το Λουτράκι με μια γρήγορη στάση στη Διώρυγα της Κορίνθου (15 λεπτά μακριά) για δραματικές φωτογραφίες του στενού διαύλου σκαλισμένου σε στερεό βράχο. Χαλαρωτική και χωρίς προσπάθεια—ιδανική αν θέλετε μια wellness μέρα με ελάχιστο προγραμματισμό.\n\n---\n\n## Πόρτο Ράφτη\n\n### Καλύτερο για γρήγορη παραλιακή απόδραση κοντά στην Αθήνα\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** Περίπου 45 λεπτά με αυτοκίνητο\n\nΤο Πόρτο Ράφτη είναι μια παραθαλάσσια πόλη δημοφιλής στους ντόπιους, ειδικά το καλοκαίρι. Οργανωμένες παραλίες, μικροί κόλποι και άφθονες παραθαλάσσιες ταβέρνες που σερβίρουν φρέσκο ψάρι και παραδοσιακά ελληνικά πιάτα. Δεν υπάρχουν σημαντικά αξιοθέατα ή μουσεία εδώ—ολόκληρος ο σκοπός είναι θάλασσα, φαγητό και να κάνετε πολύ λίγα.\n\nΑπλή και καλοκαιρινή. Τέλεια για κολύμπι, ηλιοθεραπεία και μεσημεριανό δίπλα στο νερό. Επισκεφθείτε καθημερινή για να αποφύγετε τα πλήθη του Σαββατοκύριακου—τα beach bars και οι ταβέρνες είναι πιο ήσυχα και αυθεντικά κατά τη διάρκεια της εβδομάδας.\n\n---\n\n## Μαραθώνας, Ζουμπέρι και Νέα Μάκρη\n\n### Καλύτερο για συνδυασμό ιστορίας και θάλασσας\n\n**Χρόνος διαδρομής:** 45 λεπτά έως 1 ώρα με αυτοκίνητο\n\nΑυτή η περιοχή συνδυάζει ιστορική σημασία με παραθαλάσσια ζωή. Επισκεφθείτε το χώρο της Μάχης του Μαραθώνα και τον Τύμβο του Μαραθώνα, και στη συνέχεια κατευθυνθείτε στις κοντινές παραλίες του Ζουμπερίου ή της Νέας Μάκρης για κολύμπι και φαγητό. Το Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Μαραθώνα είναι μικρό αλλά εξαιρετικό—αφιερώστε 30-45 λεπτά εκεί πριν κατευθυνθείτε στην παραλία.\n\nΗ Νέα Μάκρη ειδικά έχει έναν μακρύ παραθαλάσσιο δρόμο γεμάτο ταβέρνες και καφετέριες, καθιστώντας εύκολο το να τελειώσετε τη μέρα με ένα χαλαρό γεύμα δίπλα στη θάλασσα. Ισορροπημένη και ευέλικτη—ένας καλός συνδυασμός πολιτισμού, χρόνου στην παραλία και τοπικής κουζίνας.\n\n---\n\n## Πώς να Επιλέξετε την Κατάλληλη Ημερήσια Εκδρομή από την Αθήνα\n\n| Προτεραιότητα | Καλύτερος Προορισμός |\n|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Ιστορία και θέα** | Σούνιο |\n| **Νησιώτικη αίσθηση** | Αίγινα |\n| **Τοπική ατμόσφαιρα** | Χαλκίδα |\n| **Χαλάρωση και wellness** | Λουτράκι |\n| **Παραλίες κοντά στην πόλη** | Πόρτο Ράφτη |\n| **Ιστορία συν θάλασσα** | Μαραθώνας, Ζουμπέρι, Νέα Μάκρη |\n\n---\n\n## Πρακτικές Συμβουλές για Ημερήσιες Εκδρομές\n\n**Μεταφορές:** Νοικιάστε αυτοκίνητο για ευελιξία και πολλαπλές στάσεις (Σούνιο, Λουτράκι, Πόρτο Ράφτη). Πάρτε πλοίο για Αίγινα—εκτελούνται συχνά από το λιμάνι του Πειραιά. Χρησιμοποιήστε τρένα ή λεωφορεία για Χαλκίδα και Λουτράκι αν προτιμάτε έναν οικονομικό τρόπο.\n\n**Χρονισμός:** Ξεκινήστε νωρίς (8:00-9:00 π.μ.) για να μεγιστοποιήσετε τη μέρα σας και να αποφύγετε την κίνηση. Ελέγξτε τα δρομολόγια πλοίων εκ των προτέρων αν επισκέπτεστε την Αίγινα. Κλείστε εκδρομές ηλιοβασιλέματος για το Σούνιο εκ των προτέρων στην κορυφαία σεζόν. Αποφύγετε τα Σαββατοκύριακα για παραλιακούς προορισμούς αν προτιμάτε ήσυχες εμπειρίες.\n\n**Τι να Πακετάρετε:** Αντηλιακό και καπέλο (ο ελληνικός ήλιος είναι δυνατός όλο το χρόνο), μπουκάλι νερό (μείνετε ενυδατωμένοι, ειδικά σε αρχαιολογικούς χώρους), άνετα παπούτσια (οι αρχαίοι χώροι έχουν ανώμαλες επιφάνειες), και offline χάρτες (κατεβάστε Google Maps για περιοχές με περιορισμένο σήμα).\n\n---\n\n## Περισσότερα από το GoogleMentor\n\nΈτοιμοι να βουτήξετε πιο βαθιά; Επισκεφθείτε το [googlementor.com](https://googlementor.com) για επιμελημένους χάρτες με κρυμμένες παραλίες που χρησιμοποιούν πραγματικά οι ντόπιοι, αυθεντικές ταβέρνες σε κάθε προορισμό, γραφικά σημεία θέασης εκτός τουριστικού μονοπατιού, και εναλλακτικές διαδρομές για αποφυγή κίνησης.\n\n---\n\nΗ Αθήνα είναι περισσότερο από μια πόλη αναψυχής—είναι μια τέλεια βάση για σύντομες περιπέτειες. Ακόμα και μια επιπλέον μέρα μπορεί να σας δώσει μια εντελώς διαφορετική πλευρά της Ελλάδας.\n\nΕίτε παρακολουθείτε το ηλιοβασίλεμα στον ναό του Ποσειδώνα, τρώτε φιστίκια στο λιμάνι της Αίγινας, ή ανακαλύπτετε τα παλιρροϊκά μυστήρια της Χαλκίδας, αυτές οι ημερήσιες εκδρομές αποδεικνύουν ότι η μαγεία της Ελλάδας εκτείνεται πολύ πέρα από την Ακρόπολη.\n\nΟι περισσότεροι προορισμοί λειτουργούν όλο το χρόνο (ελέγξτε δρομολόγια πλοίων το χειμώνα). Συνδυάστε παράκτιες εκδρομές με [καιρικά πρότυπα Αθήνας](/blog/greece-weather-swimming-ferry-guide-el) για καλύτερη εμπειρία. Χρησιμοποιήστε τον [οδηγό μεταφοράς αεροδρομίου Αθηνών](/blog/athens-airport-to-city-guide-el) αν φτάνετε ή αναχωρείτε την ίδια μέρα.\n\nΞεκινήστε να προγραμματίζετε την τέλεια ημερήσια εκδρομή από την Αθήνα στο [googlementor.com](https://googlementor.com).\n\n---\n\n### Χρήσιμοι Πόροι\n\n- **Κρατήσεις πλοίων:** [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com)\n- **Ενοικιάσεις αυτοκινήτων:** Διαθέσιμες στο Αεροδρόμιο Αθηνών και κέντρο πόλης\n- **Δρομολόγια λεωφορείων:** [ΚΤΕΛ Αττικής](https://www.ktelattikis.gr)\n- **Πληροφορίες τρένων:** [TrainOSE](https://www.trainose.gr)\n","language":"el","tags":["Αθήνα","Ημερήσιες Εκδρομές","Ελλάδα","Οδηγός Ταξιδιού","Νησιά","Παραλίες"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
