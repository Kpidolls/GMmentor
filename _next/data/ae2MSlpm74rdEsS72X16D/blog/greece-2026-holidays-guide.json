Plan smart around closures, festivals, and transport disruptions.","content":"\n![Greek festival and holiday celebrations](/assets/images/greece-holidays.webp)\n\nSome Greek holidays close everything—shops, ferries, restaurants. Others bring unmissable celebrations and village festivals. Plan wrong, and you'll hit locked doors on arrival. Plan right, and you'll experience authentic culture most tourists miss. This month-by-month guide shows what actually happens on 2026's major holidays and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.\n\n## January 2026: New Year and Epiphany\n\n### Will New Year's Day (January 1) ruin my plans in Athens?\n\nYes, if you're not prepared. **January 1 is a national holiday** and almost everything shuts down:\n\n- Banks and shops are closed\n- Public transport runs on reduced schedules\n- Museums often stay shut\n- Many restaurants are fully booked or closed\n\nLocals celebrate at home with family meals and traditional **Vasilopita** (New Year's cake).\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Arrive on December 30 or 31 to enjoy festive energy without the shutdown. Stock up on essentials the day before.\n\n---\n\n### What is Epiphany (January 6), and should I avoid it?\n\n**Epiphany (Theophania)** is a major religious holiday marked by the **Blessing of the Waters** ceremony. Priests throw a cross into the sea, and brave locals dive in to retrieve it.\n\n**What's affected:**\n- Banks and public services close\n- Tourist areas generally stay open\n- Coastal cities and islands attract crowds\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Watch the ceremony in [Nafplio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTVhcLFPcRsrvnfZA) or Piraeus for a unique cultural moment. Ferry schedules can be limited, so book early.\n\n---\n\n## February–March 2026: Carnival Season\n\n### How do Carnival and Clean Monday affect travel?\n\n**Carnival season** fills cities like Patras and Xanthi with parades, costumes, and parties. Roads and buses get crowded.\n\n**Clean Monday (March 2, 2026)** marks the start of Lent and is a **national holiday**:\n- Mass picnics and kite flying\n- Heavy outbound traffic from major cities\n- Seafood-focused menus everywhere\n- Many businesses closed\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Join the festivities if you can, but reserve flights, ferries, and rental cars weeks in advance. Patras Carnival is Greece's largest.\n\n---\n\n## March 25: Independence Day & Annunciation\n\n### Is March 25 a good day for sightseeing in Athens?\n\nNot in the city center. **March 25** celebrates Greek Independence and the Annunciation with:\n\n- Military parades around Syntagma Square\n- School marches throughout the city\n- Road closures in central Athens\n- Some museums close early\n- Heavy traffic restrictions\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Visit quieter islands like [Hydra](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FE3rWWzseKREmsTP6) or enjoy the parades if you're interested in Greek history. The morning parade is spectacular for culture enthusiasts.\n\n---\n\n## April 2026: Orthodox Easter\n\n### When is Easter 2026, and why does it disrupt everything?\n\n**Orthodox Easter falls on April 12, 2026**, with:\n- **Good Friday:** April 10\n- **Holy Saturday:** April 11\n- **Easter Sunday:** April 12\n- **Easter Monday:** April 13 (national holiday)\n\nThis is **the biggest holiday of the year**:\n\n- Shops close from Thursday through Monday\n- Ferries sell out weeks in advance\n- Flights are packed\n- Entire country moves back to villages\n- Hotel prices surge 40-70%\n\n**Easter traditions you'll witness:**\n- Midnight Resurrection services\n- Fireworks at midnight Saturday\n- Candlelit processions\n- Red eggs and lamb roasting\n\n**💡 Local tip:** Book Easter travel **months ahead**.

Σχεδιάστε έξυπνα γύρω από κλεισίματα, γιορτές και διακοπές μεταφορών.","content":"\n![Ελληνικές γιορτές και εορτασμοί](/assets/images/greece-holidays.webp)\n\nΜερικές ελληνικές αργίες κλείνουν ό,τι υπάρχει—καταστήματα, πλοία, εστιατόρια. Άλλες φέρνουν αξέχαστες γιορτές και πανηγύρια. Κάνετε σχέδια λάθος και θα βρείτε κλειστές πόρτες. Κάνετε σχέδια σωστά και θα βιώσετε γνήσια τοπική κουλτούρα που χάνουν οι περισσότεροι ταξιδιώτες. Αυτός ο μηνιαίος οδηγός δείχνει τι πραγματικά συμβαίνει στις σημαντικές αργίες του 2026 και πώς να το χρησιμοποιήσετε προς όφελός σας.\n\n## Ιανουάριος 2026: Πρωτοχρονιά και Θεοφάνεια\n\n### Θα χαλάσει η Πρωτοχρονιά (1 Ιανουαρίου) τα σχέδιά μου στην Αθήνα;\n\nΝαι, αν δεν είστε προετοιμασμένοι. **Η 1η Ιανουαρίου είναι εθνική αργία** και σχεδόν όλα κλείνουν:\n\n- Τράπεζες και καταστήματα είναι κλειστά\n- Τα μέσα μεταφοράς λειτουργούν με μειωμένα δρομολόγια\n- Τα μουσεία συχνά παραμένουν κλειστά\n- Πολλά εστιατόρια είναι πλήρως κρατημένα ή κλειστά\n\nΟι ντόπιοι γιορτάζουν στο σπίτι με οικογενειακά γεύματα και την παραδοσιακή **Βασιλόπιτα**.\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Φτάστε στις 30 ή 31 Δεκεμβρίου για να απολαύσετε τη γιορτινή ατμόσφαιρα χωρίς το κλείσιμο. Αποθηκεύστε τα απαραίτητα την προηγούμενη μέρα.\n\n---\n\n### Τι είναι τα Θεοφάνεια (6 Ιανουαρίου), και πρέπει να τα αποφύγω;\n\n**Τα Θεοφάνεια** είναι μια σημαντική θρησκευτική γιορτή με την τελετή **Αγιασμού των Υδάτων**. Ιερείς ρίχνουν τον σταυρό στη θάλασσα και γενναίοι ντόπιοι βουτούν να τον ανακτήσουν.\n\n**Τι επηρεάζεται:**\n- Τράπεζες και δημόσιες υπηρεσίες κλείνουν\n- Οι τουριστικές περιοχές συνήθως παραμένουν ανοιχτές\n- Παράκτιες πόλεις και νησιά προσελκύουν πλήθη\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Παρακολουθήστε την τελετή στο [Ναύπλιο](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTVhcLFPcRsrvnfZA) ή τον Πειραιά για μια μοναδική πολιτιστική στιγμή. Τα δρομολόγια ferry μπορεί να είναι περιορισμένα, οπότε κλείστε νωρίς.\n\n---\n\n## Φεβρουάριος-Μάρτιος 2026: Καρναβάλι\n\n### Πώς επηρεάζουν το Καρναβάλι και η Καθαρά Δευτέρα το ταξίδι;\n\n**Η περίοδος Καρναβαλιού** γεμίζει πόλεις όπως η Πάτρα και η Ξάνθη με παρελάσεις, κοστούμια και πάρτι. Οι δρόμοι και τα λεωφορεία γεμίζουν.\n\n**Καθαρά Δευτέρα (2 Μαρτίου 2026)** σηματοδοτεί την έναρξη της Σαρακοστής και είναι **εθνική αργία**:\n- Μαζικά πικνικ και πέταγμα χαρταετών\n- Μεγάλη εξερχόμενη κίνηση από τις μεγάλες πόλεις\n- Μενού με έμφαση στα θαλασσινά παντού\n- Πολλές επιχειρήσεις κλειστές\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Συμμετάστε στις γιορτές αν μπορείτε, αλλά κρατήστε πτήσεις, ferry και ενοικιαζόμενα αυτοκίνητα εβδομάδες νωρίτερα. Το Καρναβάλι της Πάτρας είναι το μεγαλύτερο της Ελλάδας.\n\n---\n\n## 25 Μαρτίου: Ημέρα Ανεξαρτησίας & Ευαγγελισμός\n\n### Είναι η 25η Μαρτίου καλή μέρα για περιήγηση στην Αθήνα;\n\nΌχι στο κέντρο της πόλης. **Η 25η Μαρτίου** γιορτάζει την Ελληνική Ανεξαρτησία και τον Ευαγγελισμό με:\n\n- Στρατιωτικές παρελάσεις γύρω από την Πλατεία Συντάγματος\n- Σχολικές παρελάσεις σε όλη την πόλη\n- Κλείσιμο δρόμων στο κέντρο της Αθήνας\n- Μερικά μουσεία κλείνουν νωρίς\n- Βαριοί περιορισμοί κυκλοφορίας\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Επισκεφθείτε ήσυχα νησιά όπως η [Ύδρα](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FE3rWWzseKREmsTP6) ή απολαύστε τις παρελάσεις αν ενδιαφέρεστε για την ελληνική ιστορία. Η πρωινή παρέλαση είναι εντυπωσιακή για τους λάτρεις της κουλτούρας.\n\n---\n\n## Απρίλιος 2026: Ορθόδοξο Πάσχα\n\n### Πότε είναι το Πάσχα 2026, και γιατί διαταράσσει τα πάντα;\n\n**Το Ορθόδοξο Πάσχα πέφτει στις 12 Απριλίου 2026**, με:\n- **Μεγάλη Παρασκευή:** 10 Απριλίου\n- **Μεγάλο Σάββατο:** 11 Απριλίου\n- **Κυριακή του Πάσχα:** 12 Απριλίου\n- **Δευτέρα του Πάσχα:** 13 Απριλίου (εθνική αργία)\n\nΑυτή είναι **η μεγαλύτερη γιορτή του χρόνου**:\n\n- Τα καταστήματα κλείνουν από Πέμπτη έως Δευτέρα\n- Τα ferry εξαντλούνται εβδομάδες νωρίτερα\n- Οι πτήσεις είναι γεμάτες\n- Όλη η χώρα μετακινείται πίσω στα χωριά\n- Οι τιμές των ξενοδοχείων αυξάνονται 40-70%\n\n**Πασχαλινές παραδόσεις που θα δείτε:**\n- Ακολουθίες Ανάστασης τα μεσάνυχτα\n- Πυροτεχνήματα τα μεσάνυχτα του Σαββάτου\n- Λιτανείες με κεριά\n- Κόκκινα αυγά και ψήσιμο αρνιού\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Κλείστε πασχαλινά ταξίδια **μήνες νωρίτερα**. Νησιά όπως η Μύκονος και η Σαντορίνη προσφέρουν εκπληκτικές πασχαλινές παραδόσεις χωρίς τον συνωστισμό του χωριού. [Το Πάσχα στην Κέρκυρα](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9fSrbmQQu6eCHA6H9) είναι θρυλικό.\n\n---\n\n## Μάιος 2026: Πρωτομαγιά\n\n### Σημαίνει η Πρωτομαγιά (1 Μαΐου) διαδηλώσεις στην Αθήνα;\n\nΝαι. **Η Πρωτομαγιά είναι Εργατική Πρωτομαγιά**, που συχνά σηματοδοτείται από:\n\n- Πορείες και διαδηλώσεις στο κέντρο της Αθήνας\n- Κλείσιμο δρόμων γύρω από το Σύνταγμα\n- Διαταραχές στις μεταφορές\n- Τράπεζες και πολλές επιχειρήσεις κλειστές\n\nΟι περισσότερες διαδηλώσεις είναι ειρηνικές, αλλά αναμένετε ισχυρή αστυνομική παρουσία.\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Αποφύγετε το κέντρο της Αθήνας. Επισκεφθείτε τους Δελφούς, τα Μετέωρα ή κάντε νησιώτικα χοπ. Οι ντόπιοι παραδοσιακά κάνουν πικνικ στη φύση με στεφάνια αγριολούλουδων.\n\n---\n\n## Ιούνιος 2026: Αγίου Πνεύματος\n\n### Τι είναι η Δευτέρα του Αγίου Πνεύματος (1 Ιουνίου), και πρέπει να ανησυχώ;\n\n**Η Δευτέρα του Αγίου Πνεύματος** είναι δημόσια αργία για πολλούς τομείς, αλλά ο τουρισμός συνεχίζεται κανονικά:\n\n- Τα τουριστικά καταστήματα και εστιατόρια παραμένουν ανοιχτά\n- Τα ferry λειτουργούν κανονικά\n- Τα μουσεία λειτουργούν κανονικά\n- Τράπεζες κλειστές\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Ιδανικός χρόνος για σύντομα νησιώτικα ταξίδια με λιγότερο κόσμο. Τέλεια γέφυρα για την πρώιμη καλοκαιρινή περίοδο.\n\n---\n\n## Αύγουστος 2026: Αιχμή Σεζόν και Δεκαπενταύγουστος\n\n### Πρέπει να επισκεφθώ την Ελλάδα στις 15 Αυγούστου;\n\n**Μόνο αν θέλετε να ζήσετε αληθινή ελληνική παράδοση.** Ο Δεκαπενταύγουστος είναι μία από τις μεγαλύτερες θρησκευτικές γιορτές του χρόνου:\n\n**Περιμένετε:**\n- Ευρεία κλεισίματα (καταστήματα, τράπεζες, γραφεία)\n- Χωριάτικες γιορτές (**πανηγύρια**) παντού\n- Μουσική, φαγητό και χορός μέχρι το ξημέρωμα\n- Αυξήσεις τιμών σε ferry και πτήσεις\n- Ξενοδοχεία πλήρως κρατημένα στα νησιά\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Επισκεφθείτε την **Τήνο** για προσκυνήματα και εορτασμούς. Αποφύγετε αυτήν την ημερομηνία αν προτιμάτε πλήρως λειτουργικές πόλεις. Τα νησιώτικα πανηγύρια είναι αξέχαστες πολιτιστικές εμπειρίες.\n\n---\n\n## Σεπτέμβριος 2026: Επιστροφή στην Πραγματικότητα\n\n### Επηρεάζει η έναρξη της σχολικής χρονιάς τον Σεπτέμβριο το ταξίδι;\n\nΓύρω στα **μέσα Σεπτεμβρίου**, η Αθήνα γίνεται πιο πολυσύχναστη καθώς οι οικογένειες επιστρέφουν και η κυκλοφορία αυξάνεται. Δεν είναι αργία, αλλά η καθημερινή ζωή επιταχύνεται ξανά.\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Τα νησιά παραμένουν χαλαρά και καλοκαιρινά. **Τέλη Αυγούστου έως μέσα Σεπτεμβρίου** είναι μια εξαιρετική ισορροπία—ζεστός καιρός, λιγότεροι τουρίστες, χαμηλότερες τιμές.\n\n---\n\n## 🪖 28 Οκτωβρίου: Ημέρα του ΟΧΙ\n\n### Τι συμβαίνει την Ημέρα του ΟΧΙ (28 Οκτωβρίου);\n\n**Η Ημέρα του ΟΧΙ** τιμά την άρνηση της Ελλάδας να παραδοθεί στον Β' Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο:\n\n- Παρελάσεις σε κάθε πόλη και χωριό\n- Σχολικά κλεισίματα σε όλη τη χώρα\n- Περιορισμένες επιχειρηματικές λειτουργίες\n- Εθνική περηφάνια σε πλήρη επίδειξη\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Η Θεσσαλονίκη φιλοξενεί τη μεγαλύτερη στρατιωτική παρέλαση. Οι μικρότερες πόλεις αισθάνονται γιορτινές και ήρεμες—ιδανικές για αυθεντικές τοπικές εμπειρίες.\n\n---\n\n## 📢 17 Νοεμβρίου: Επέτειος Πολυτεχνείου\n\n### Είναι δύσκολη η 17η Νοεμβρίου για τους τουρίστες;\n\n**Η 17η Νοεμβρίου** σηματοδοτεί την επέτειο της εξέγερσης του Πολυτεχνείου με:\n\n- Πορείες και διαδηλώσεις, ειδικά στην Αθήνα\n- Ισχυρή αστυνομική παρουσία γύρω από τα Εξάρχεια\n- Κλείσιμο δρόμων σε κεντρικές περιοχές\n- Γενικά ειρηνική αλλά τεταμένη ατμόσφαιρα\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Μείνετε μακριά από τις διαδρομές διαδηλώσεων ή σχεδιάστε νησιώτικα ταξίδια αν είναι δυνατόν. Οι περισσότερες τουριστικές περιοχές παραμένουν ανεπηρέαστες.\n\n---\n\n## 🎄 Δεκέμβριος 2026: Χριστουγεννιάτικη Περίοδος\n\n### Είναι ασφαλής η Αθήνα στις 6 Δεκεμβρίου;\n\n**Η 6η Δεκεμβρίου** τιμά τη μνήμη του Αλέξη Γρηγορόπουλου το 2008:\n\n- Λαμβάνουν χώρα αγρυπνίες και πορείες\n- Κυρίως ειρηνικές αλλά τεταμένες σε κάποιες περιοχές\n- Επιπλέον αστυνομική παρουσία στα Εξάρχεια\n\n**Χριστούγεννα (25-26 Δεκεμβρίου)** φέρνουν:\n- Ευρεία κλεισίματα\n- Οικογενειακούς εορτασμούς\n- Μειωμένα δρομολόγια ferry\n- Χριστουγεννιάτικες αγορές στις μεγάλες πόλεις\n\n**💡 Τοπική συμβουλή:** Απολαύστε τις χριστουγεννιάτικες αγορές στη Θεσσαλονίκη και την [Αθήνα](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cUsbK1QPMZoAt1976). Σχεδιάστε πτήσεις πριν από τις 26 Δεκεμβρίου.
