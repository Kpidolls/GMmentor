Plan smart around closures, festivals, and transport disruptions.","content":"\n![Greek festival and holiday celebrations](/assets/images/greece-holidays.webp)\n\nSome Greek holidays close everything—shops, ferries, restaurants. Others bring unmissable celebrations and village festivals. Plan wrong, and you'll hit locked doors on arrival. Plan right, and you'll experience authentic culture most tourists miss. This month-by-month guide shows what actually happens on 2026's major holidays and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.\n\n## January 2026: New Year and Epiphany\n\n### Will New Year's Day (January 1) ruin my plans in Athens?\n\nYes, if you're not prepared. **January 1 is a national holiday** and almost everything shuts down:\n\n- Banks and shops are closed\n- Public transport runs on reduced schedules\n- Museums often stay shut\n- Many restaurants are fully booked or closed\n\nLocals celebrate at home with family meals and traditional **Vasilopita** (New Year's cake). The smart move? Arrive on December 30 or 31—you'll catch the festive energy when everything's still open, then enjoy a quiet January 1 after stocking up on essentials the night before.\n\n---\n\n### What is Epiphany (January 6), and should I avoid it?\n\n**Epiphany (Theophania)** is a major religious holiday marked by the **Blessing of the Waters** ceremony. Priests throw a cross into the sea, and brave locals dive in to retrieve it.\n\nBanks and public services close for the day, but tourist areas generally stay open. Coastal cities and islands attract crowds, especially where the ceremonies take place—it's genuinely worth seeing. Nafplio and Piraeus host particularly memorable ceremonies, with locals diving into frigid January water to retrieve the blessed cross. Just book ferries early since schedules get reduced.\n\n---\n\n## February–March 2026: Carnival Season\n\n### How do Carnival and Clean Monday affect travel?\n\n**Carnival season** fills cities like Patras and Xanthi with parades, costumes, and parties. Roads and buses get crowded.\n\n**Clean Monday (March 2, 2026)** marks the start of Lent and is a national holiday. Greeks flood out of cities for mass picnics and kite flying—you'll see families covering hillsides with colorful kites. Seafood dominates restaurant menus (meat is off the table for Lent), and many businesses close for the day. If you're traveling during this period, book flights, ferries, and rental cars weeks ahead. Traffic out of Athens can be brutal. Patras Carnival is Greece's largest if you want to catch the peak festivities beforehand.\n\n---\n\n## March 25: Independence Day & Annunciation\n\n### Is March 25 a good day for sightseeing in Athens?\n\nNot in the city center. **March 25** celebrates Greek Independence and the Annunciation with:\n\nMilitary parades take over Syntagma Square, school children march throughout the city, and road closures make central Athens a headache. Some museums close early, and traffic restrictions are heavy. If Greek history interests you, the morning parade is genuinely spectacular—flags, uniforms, and genuine national pride. Otherwise, quieter islands like Hydra make for a peaceful alternative.\n\n---\n\n## April 2026: Orthodox Easter\n\n### When is Easter 2026, and why does it disrupt everything?\n\n**Orthodox Easter falls on April 12, 2026**, with:\n- **Good Friday:** April 10\n- **Holy Saturday:** April 11\n- **Easter Sunday:** April 12\n- **Easter Monday:** April 13 (national holiday)\n\nThis is **the biggest holiday of the year**:\n\n- Shops close from Thursday through Monday\n- Ferries sell out weeks in advance\n- Flights are packed\n- Entire country moves back to villages\n- Hotel prices surge 40-70%\n\nEaster traditions are worth experiencing: midnight Resurrection services with fireworks exploding at the stroke of midnight Saturday, candlelit processions winding through villages, red eggs everywhere, and the smell of lamb roasting on spits from morning until late afternoon. Just book travel months ahead—this isn't negotiable. Islands like Mykonos and Santorini offer stunning traditions without the village-level family intensity. Corfu's Easter is legendary, with locals throwing clay pots from balconies and hosting elaborate processions.\n\n---\n\n## May 2026: Labor Day\n\n### Does May Day (May 1) mean protests in Athens?\n\nYes. **May Day is Labor Day**, often marked by:\n\n- Marches and demonstrations in central Athens\n- Road closures around Syntagma\n- Transport disruptions\n- Banks and many businesses closed\n\nMost protests are peaceful, but expect heavy police presence throughout the center. Skip central Athens entirely—Delphi, Meteora, or island hopping make better choices. Greeks traditionally head to nature for picnics, weaving wildflower wreaths as part of the May Day tradition.\n\n---\n\n## June 2026: Holy Spirit Monday\n\n### What is Holy Spirit Monday (June 1), and should I worry?\n\n**Holy Spirit Monday** is a public holiday for many sectors, but tourism continues normally:\n\nTourist shops and restaurants stay open, ferries run as usual, and museums operate normally. Only banks close. It's ideal timing for short island trips—crowds are lighter, and you're catching the perfect bridge into early summer weather.\n\n---\n\n## August 2026: Peak Season and Assumption Day\n\n### Should I visit Greece on Assumption Day (August 15)?\n\n**Only if you want to experience real Greek tradition.** August 15 is one of the biggest religious holidays of the year:\n\nExpect widespread closures—shops, banks, offices shut down—but village festivals (panigyria) burst to life everywhere. Music, food, and dancing go until dawn. Ferry and flight prices surge, and island hotels book out entirely. Tinos is the pilgrimage center of Greece on this day, with thousands walking to the island's famous church. The island festivals are genuinely unforgettable if you can handle the chaos. If you need everything operational, skip this date entirely.\n\n---\n\n## September 2026: Back to Reality\n\n### Does the school year start in September affect travel?\n\nAround mid-September, Athens shifts gears as families return from summer holidays and traffic picks up. It's not a holiday, but you'll notice the city speeding up. Islands stay relaxed and summery, though. Late August to mid-September hits a sweet spot—warm water, fewer crowds, and prices dropping from August peaks.\n\n---\n\n## October 28: OXI Day\n\n### What happens on OXI Day (October 28)?\n\n**OXI Day** commemorates Greece's refusal to surrender in World War II:\n\nParades march through every town and city, schools close nationwide, and business operations are limited. National pride is on full display—Greeks take this commemoration seriously. Thessaloniki hosts the largest military parade if you want the full spectacle. Smaller towns feel festive but calm, offering more authentic local experiences without the crowds.\n\n---\n\n## November 17: Polytechnic Uprising Anniversary\n\n### Is November 17 difficult for tourists?\n\n**November 17** marks the Polytechnic Uprising anniversary with:\n\nMarches and demonstrations take place, especially in Athens around the Exarchia neighborhood. Police presence is heavy, road closures affect central areas, and the atmosphere can feel tense even though things usually stay peaceful. Stay away from protest routes if you're uncomfortable, or just plan island trips. Most tourist areas remain unaffected anyway.\n\n---\n\n## December 2026: Christmas Season\n\n### Is Athens safe on December 6?\n\n**December 6** commemorates the 2008 killing of Alexis Grigoropoulos:\n\n- Vigils and marches take place\n- Mostly peaceful but tense in some areas\n- Extra police presence in Exarchia\n\nChristmas (December 25-26) brings widespread closures, family celebrations, and reduced ferry schedules. Christmas markets pop up in major cities, though—Thessaloniki and Athens both host beautiful ones worth visiting. Plan flights before December 26 when possible, since everything tightens up. New Year's Eve in Athens is spectacular, with fireworks over the Acropolis and crowds filling the center.\n\n---\n\n## 2026 Greece Holiday Calendar Quick Reference\n\n| Date | Holiday | Impact Level | What Closes |\n|------|---------|--------------|-------------|\n| Jan 1 | New Year's Day | High | Everything |\n| Jan 6 | Epiphany | Medium | Banks, offices |\n| Mar 2 | Clean Monday | High | Most businesses |\n| Mar 25 | Independence Day | High | Government, banks |\n| Apr 10-13 | Orthodox Easter | Very High | Everything 4 days |\n| May 1 | Labor Day | Medium-High | Banks, offices |\n| Jun 1 | Holy Spirit Monday | Low-Medium | Banks |\n| Aug 15 | Assumption Day | Very High | Most businesses |\n| Oct 28 | OXI Day | Medium-High | Government, banks |\n| Dec 25-26 | Christmas | High | Most businesses |\n\n---\n\n## Travel Planning for 2026 Greece Holidays\n\nBefore you book anything, check ferry schedules around holidays—they change constantly and often go offline without warning. For Easter travel specifically, book 2-3 months ahead or accept that you'll pay surge prices for whatever's left. Download a Greek Orthodox calendar for your travel dates so religious holidays don't blindside you. Travel insurance becomes essential during holiday periods when disruptions multiply.\n\nPricing swings wildly during peak periods. Expect 30-70% increases for Easter week (April 10-13), the August 15 weekend, and Christmas/New Year. Islands in mid-September through mid-October offer the best balance—weather's still excellent, prices drop from summer peaks, and crowds thin out. Skip Athens on protest dates (May 1, November 17, December 6) unless you're specifically interested in the demonstrations. Most importantly, embrace local festivals instead of working around them. The disruption is real, but the cultural payoff makes it worthwhile.\n\n---\n\n## When to Visit Greece in 2026\n\nLate May through early June brings perfect weather before peak-season prices hit. Late September to mid-October offers warm seas, autumn colors starting to show in the mountains, and genuinely quiet islands. Mid-October into November works brilliantly for mainland exploration—cultural sites, hiking, cooler weather, and low-season calm.\n\nFor smooth, disruption-free travel, avoid Easter week (April 10-13) entirely unless you specifically want the cultural immersion. The August 15 weekend combines peak summer chaos with a major holiday—it's genuinely overwhelming. Christmas week limits services significantly.\n\nCulture seekers should target specific events: Carnival season (February-March) in Patras or Xanthi, Easter (April 12) on Corfu or Chios or Hydra, August 15 in Tinos for the pilgrimage atmosphere, and OXI Day (October 28) in Thessaloniki for the military parade.\n\n---\n\n## More from GoogleMentor\n\nPlanning around holidays covers the basics, but Greece rewards deeper research. For curated restaurant recommendations, seasonal travel strategies, and island-specific guides, visit [googlementor.com/guides](https://googlementor.com). You'll find hidden tavernas that actually stay open during holidays, ferry alternatives when main routes sell out, and transport workarounds for closure days.\n\nGreek holidays aren't obstacles if you plan properly. They're actually some of the best windows into authentic culture—assuming you've booked ahead and know what to expect. Book early for Easter, August 15, and Christmas. Check official schedules weekly as dates approach, since ferry companies and museums love last-minute changes. Keep emergency contacts accessible, and build flexible backup plans for major closure periods.\n\nFor more curated local recommendations and seasonal guidance, visit [googlementor.com](https://googlementor.com).\n\n---\n\n### Official Resources\n\n- **Ferry schedules:** [Ferryhopper](https://www.ferryhopper.com)\n- **Athens transport:** [OASA](https://www.oasa.gr/en/)\n- **Museum updates:** [Ministry of Culture](https://www.culture.gov.gr/en/)\n- **Greek Orthodox calendar:** [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_liturgical_calendar)\n","language":"en","tags":["Greece","Travel Guide","Holidays","2026","Planning","Events"]},"mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = {\n    a: \"a\",\n    h2: \"h2\",\n    h3: \"h3\",\n    hr: \"hr\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    p: \"p\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    table: \"table\",\n    tbody: \"tbody\",\n    td: \"td\",\n    th: \"th\",\n    thead: \"thead\",\n    tr: \"tr\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    ..._provideComponents(),\n    ...props.components\n  };\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: _jsx(_components.img, {\n        src: \"/assets/images/greece-holidays.webp\",\n        alt: \"Greek festival and holiday celebrations\"\n      })\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Some Greek holidays close everything—shops, ferries, restaurants.

Άλλες φέρνουν αξέχαστες γιορτές και πανηγύρια. Κάνετε σχέδια λάθος και θα βρείτε κλειστές πόρτες. Κάνετε σχέδια σωστά και θα βιώσετε γνήσια τοπική κουλτούρα που χάνουν οι περισσότεροι ταξιδιώτες. Αυτός ο μηνιαίος οδηγός δείχνει τι πραγματικά συμβαίνει στις σημαντικές αργίες του 2026 και πώς να το χρησιμοποιήσετε προς όφελός σας.\n\n## Ιανουάριος 2026: Πρωτοχρονιά και Θεοφάνεια\n\n### Θα χαλάσει η Πρωτοχρονιά (1 Ιανουαρίου) τα σχέδιά μου στην Αθήνα;\n\nΝαι, αν δεν είστε προετοιμασμένοι. **Η 1η Ιανουαρίου είναι εθνική αργία** και σχεδόν όλα κλείνουν:\n\n- Τράπεζες και καταστήματα είναι κλειστά\n- Τα μέσα μεταφοράς λειτουργούν με μειωμένα δρομολόγια\n- Τα μουσεία συχνά παραμένουν κλειστά\n- Πολλά εστιατόρια είναι πλήρως κρατημένα ή κλειστά\n\nΟι ντόπιοι γιορτάζουν στο σπίτι με οικογενειακά γεύματα και την παραδοσιακή **Βασιλόπιτα**. Η έξυπνη κίνηση; Φτάστε στις 30 ή 31 Δεκεμβρίου—θα πετύχετε τη γιορτινή ατμόσφαιρα όταν όλα είναι ακόμα ανοιχτά, και μετά απολαύστε μια ήσυχη 1η Ιανουαρίου αφού αποθηκεύσετε τα απαραίτητα το προηγούμενο βράδυ.\n\n---\n\n### Τι είναι τα Θεοφάνεια (6 Ιανουαρίου), και πρέπει να τα αποφύγω;\n\n**Τα Θεοφάνεια** είναι μια σημαντική θρησκευτική γιορτή με την τελετή **Αγιασμού των Υδάτων**. Ιερείς ρίχνουν τον σταυρό στη θάλασσα και γενναίοι ντόπιοι βουτούν να τον ανακτήσουν.\n\nΟι τράπεζες και οι δημόσιες υπηρεσίες κλείνουν για τη μέρα, αλλά οι τουριστικές περιοχές συνήθως παραμένουν ανοιχτές. Παράκτιες πόλεις και νησιά προσελκύουν πλήθη, ειδικά εκεί που πραγματοποιούνται οι τελετές—αξίζει πραγματικά να το δείτε. Το Ναύπλιο και ο Πειραιάς φιλοξενούν ιδιαίτερα αξιομνημόνευτες τελετές, με ντόπιους να βουτούν στο παγωμένο νερό του Ιανουαρίου για να ανακτήσουν το σταυρό. Απλώς κλείστε ferry νωρίς αφού τα δρομολόγια μειώνονται.\n\n---\n\n## Φεβρουάριος-Μάρτιος 2026: Καρναβάλι\n\n### Πώς επηρεάζουν το Καρναβάλι και η Καθαρά Δευτέρα το ταξίδι;\n\n**Η περίοδος Καρναβαλιού** γεμίζει πόλεις όπως η Πάτρα και η Ξάνθη με παρελάσεις, κοστούμια και πάρτι. Οι δρόμοι και τα λεωφορεία γεμίζουν.\n\n**Καθαρά Δευτέρα (2 Μαρτίου 2026)** σηματοδοτεί την έναρξη της Σαρακοστής και είναι εθνική αργία. Οι Έλληνες πλημμυρίζουν έξω από τις πόλεις για μαζικά πικνικ και πέταγμα χαρταετών—θα δείτε οικογένειες να καλύπτουν λόφους με πολύχρωμους χαρταετούς. Τα θαλασσινά κυριαρχούν στα μενού των εστιατορίων (το κρέας είναι εκτός για τη Σαρακοστή), και πολλές επιχειρήσεις κλείνουν για τη μέρα. Αν ταξιδεύετε σε αυτή την περίοδο, κλείστε πτήσεις, ferry και ενοικιαζόμενα αυτοκίνητα εβδομάδες νωρίτερα. Η κίνηση έξω από την Αθήνα μπορεί να είναι βάναυση. Το Καρναβάλι της Πάτρας είναι το μεγαλύτερο της Ελλάδας αν θέλετε να πετύχετε τις κορυφαίες γιορτές πριν.\n\n---\n\n## 25 Μαρτίου: Ημέρα Ανεξαρτησίας & Ευαγγελισμός\n\n### Είναι η 25η Μαρτίου καλή μέρα για περιήγηση στην Αθήνα;\n\nΌχι στο κέντρο της πόλης. **Η 25η Μαρτίου** γιορτάζει την Ελληνική Ανεξαρτησία και τον Ευαγγελισμό με:\n\nΣτρατιωτικές παρελάσεις καταλαμβάνουν την Πλατεία Συντάγματος, παιδιά από σχολεία παρελαύνουν σε όλη την πόλη, και το κλείσιμο δρόμων κάνει το κέντρο της Αθήνας ένα πονοκέφαλο. Μερικά μουσεία κλείνουν νωρίς και οι περιορισμοί κυκλοφορίας είναι βαριοί. Αν η ελληνική ιστορία σας ενδιαφέρει, η πρωινή παρέλαση είναι πραγματικά εντυπωσιακή—σημαίες, στολές και γνήσια εθνική περηφάνια. Αλλιώς, ήσυχα νησιά όπως η Ύδρα αποτελούν μια ειρηνική εναλλακτική.\n\n---\n\n## Απρίλιος 2026: Ορθόδοξο Πάσχα\n\n### Πότε είναι το Πάσχα 2026, και γιατί διαταράσσει τα πάντα;\n\n**Το Ορθόδοξο Πάσχα πέφτει στις 12 Απριλίου 2026**, με:\n- **Μεγάλη Παρασκευή:** 10 Απριλίου\n- **Μεγάλο Σάββατο:** 11 Απριλίου\n- **Κυριακή του Πάσχα:** 12 Απριλίου\n- **Δευτέρα του Πάσχα:** 13 Απριλίου (εθνική αργία)\n\nΑυτή είναι **η μεγαλύτερη γιορτή του χρόνου**:\n\n- Τα καταστήματα κλείνουν από Πέμπτη έως Δευτέρα\n- Τα ferry εξαντλούνται εβδομάδες νωρίτερα\n- Οι πτήσεις είναι γεμάτες\n- Όλη η χώρα μετακινείται πίσω στα χωριά\n- Οι τιμές των ξενοδοχείων αυξάνονται 40-70%\n\nΟι πασχαλινές παραδόσεις αξίζουν να βιωθούν: ακολουθίες Ανάστασης τα μεσάνυχτα με πυροτεχνήματα που εκρήγνυνται με το χτύπημα των μεσανύχτων του Σαββάτου, λιτανείες με κεριά που ανεβαίνουν σε χωριά, κόκκινα αυγά παντού, και η μυρωδιά αρνιού που ψήνεται στη σούβλα από το πρωί μέχρι αργά το απόγευμα. Απλώς κλείστε ταξίδια μήνες νωρίτερα—αυτό δεν είναι διαπραγματεύσιμο. Νησιά όπως η Μύκονος και η Σαντορίνη προσφέρουν εκπληκτικές παραδόσεις χωρίς την ένταση σε επίπεδο χωριού. Το Πάσχα στην Κέρκυρα είναι θρυλικό, με ντόπιους να ρίχνουν πήλινες γλάστρες από μπαλκόνια και να φιλοξενούν επεξεργασμένες λιτανείες.\n\n---\n\n## Μάιος 2026: Πρωτομαγιά\n\n### Σημαίνει η Πρωτομαγιά (1 Μαΐου) διαδηλώσεις στην Αθήνα;\n\nΝαι. **Η Πρωτομαγιά είναι Εργατική Πρωτομαγιά**, που συχνά σηματοδοτείται από:\n\n- Πορείες και διαδηλώσεις στο κέντρο της Αθήνας\n- Κλείσιμο δρόμων γύρω από το Σύνταγμα\n- Διαταραχές στις μεταφορές\n- Τράπεζες και πολλές επιχειρήσεις κλειστές\n\nΟι περισσότερες διαδηλώσεις είναι ειρηνικές, αλλά αναμένετε ισχυρή αστυνομική παρουσία σε όλο το κέντρο. Παραλείψτε το κέντρο της Αθήνας εντελώς—οι Δελφοί, τα Μετέωρα ή νησιώτικα χοπ κάνουν καλύτερες επιλογές. Οι Έλληνες παραδοσιακά πηγαίνουν στη φύση για πικνικ, πλέκοντας στεφάνια αγριολούλουδων ως μέρος της παράδοσης της Πρωτομαγιάς.\n\n---\n\n## Ιούνιος 2026: Αγίου Πνεύματος\n\n### Τι είναι η Δευτέρα του Αγίου Πνεύματος (1 Ιουνίου), και πρέπει να ανησυχώ;\n\n**Η Δευτέρα του Αγίου Πνεύματος** είναι δημόσια αργία για πολλούς τομείς, αλλά ο τουρισμός συνεχίζεται κανονικά:\n\nΤα τουριστικά καταστήματα και εστιατόρια παραμένουν ανοιχτά, τα ferry λειτουργούν κανονικά και τα μουσεία λειτουργούν κανονικά. Μόνο οι τράπεζες κλείνουν. Είναι ιδανικός χρόνος για σύντομα νησιώτικα ταξίδια—ο κόσμος είναι λιγότερος και πετυχαίνετε την τέλεια γέφυρα στις αρχές του καλοκαιριού.\n\n---\n\n## Αύγουστος 2026: Αιχμή Σεζόν και Δεκαπενταύγουστος\n\n### Πρέπει να επισκεφθώ την Ελλάδα στις 15 Αυγούστου;\n\n**Μόνο αν θέλετε να ζήσετε αληθινή ελληνική παράδοση.** Ο Δεκαπενταύγουστος είναι μία από τις μεγαλύτερες θρησκευτικές γιορτές του χρόνου:\n\nΑναμένετε ευρεία κλεισίματα—καταστήματα, τράπεζες, γραφεία κλείνουν—αλλά χωριάτικες γιορτές (πανηγύρια) εκρήγνυνται παντού. Μουσική, φαγητό και χορός μέχρι το ξημέρωμα. Οι τιμές ferry και πτήσεων εκτινάσσονται και τα νησιώτικα ξενοδοχεία κλείνονται εντελώς. Η Τήνος είναι το κέντρο προσκυνήματος της Ελλάδας αυτή τη μέρα, με χιλιάδες να περπατούν προς τη διάσημη εκκλησία του νησιού. Τα νησιώτικα πανηγύρια είναι πραγματικά αξέχαστα αν μπορείτε να αντιμετωπίσετε το χάος. Αν χρειάζεστε όλα λειτουργικά, παραλείψτε εντελώς αυτή την ημερομηνία.\n\n---\n\n## Σεπτέμβριος 2026: Επιστροφή στην Πραγματικότητα\n\n### Επηρεάζει η έναρξη της σχολικής χρονιάς τον Σεπτέμβριο το ταξίδι;\n\nΓύρω στα μέσα Σεπτεμβρίου, η Αθήνα αλλάζει ταχύτητες καθώς οι οικογένειες επιστρέφουν από τις καλοκαιρινές διακοπές και η κυκλοφορία αυξάνεται. Δεν είναι αργία, αλλά θα παρατηρήσετε την πόλη να επιταχύνεται. Τα νησιά παραμένουν χαλαρά και καλοκαιρινά. Τέλη Αυγούστου έως μέσα Σεπτεμβρίου βρίσκει ένα γλυκό σημείο—ζεστό νερό, λιγότεροι τουρίστες και τιμές που πέφτουν από τις κορυφές Αυγούστου.\n\n---\n\n## 28 Οκτωβρίου: Ημέρα του ΟΧΙ\n\n### Τι συμβαίνει την Ημέρα του ΟΧΙ (28 Οκτωβρίου);\n\nΠαρελάσεις διαδραματίζονται σε κάθε πόλη και χωριό, σχολεία κλείνουν σε όλη τη χώρα και οι επιχειρηματικές λειτουργίες είναι περιορισμένες. Η εθνική περηφάνια είναι σε πλήρη επίδειξη—οι Έλληνες παίρνουν σοβαρά αυτό το μνημόσυνο. Η Θεσσαλονίκη φιλοξενεί τη μεγαλύτερη στρατιωτική παρέλαση αν θέλετε το πλήρες θέαμα. Οι μικρότερες πόλεις αισθάνονται γιορτινές αλλά ήρεμες, προσφέροντας πιο αυθεντικές τοπικές εμπειρίες χωρίς τα πλήθη.\n\n---\n\n## 17 Νοεμβρίου: Επέτειος Πολυτεχνείου\n\n### Είναι δύσκολη η 17η Νοεμβρίου για τους τουρίστες;\n\nΛαμβάνουν χώρα πορείες και διαδηλώσεις, ειδικά στην Αθήνα γύρω από τα Εξάρχεια. Η αστυνομική παρουσία είναι βαριά, το κλείσιμο δρόμων επηρεάζει κεντρικές περιοχές και η ατμόσφαιρα μπορεί να αισθάνεται τεταμένη ακόμα και αν τα πράγματα συνήθως παραμένουν ειρηνικά. Μείνετε μακριά από τις διαδρομές διαδηλώσεων αν αισθάνεστε άβολα, ή απλώς σχεδιάστε νησιώτικα ταξίδια. Οι περισσότερες τουριστικές περιοχές παραμένουν ανεπηρέαστες.\n\n---\n\n## Δεκέμβριος 2026: Χριστουγεννιάτικη Περίοδος\n\n### Είναι ασφαλής η Αθήνα στις 6 Δεκεμβρίου;\n\nΗ 6η Δεκεμβρίου τιμά τη μνήμη του Αλέξη Γρηγορόπουλου το 2008 με αγρυπνίες και πορείες. Κυρίως ειρηνικές αλλά τεταμένες σε κάποιες περιοχές, με επιπλέον αστυνομική παρουσία στα Εξάρχεια.\n\nΤα Χριστούγεννα (25-26 Δεκεμβρίου) φέρνουν ευρεία κλεισίματα, οικογενειακούς εορτασμούς και μειωμένα δρομολόγια ferry. Χριστουγεννιάτικες αγορές εμφανίζονται σε μεγάλες πόλεις, όμως—η Θεσσαλονίκη και η Αθήνα φιλοξενούν όμορφες που αξίζει να επισκεφθείτε. Σχεδιάστε πτήσεις πριν από τις 26 Δεκεμβρίου όταν είναι δυνατόν, αφού όλα σφίγγονται. Η Πρωτοχρονιά στην Αθήνα είναι θεαματική, με πυροτεχνήματα πάνω από την Ακρόπολη και πλήθη να γεμίζουν το κέντρο.\n\n---\n\n## Ημερολόγιο Αργιών Ελλάδας 2026 - Γρήγορη Αναφορά\n\n| Ημερομηνία | Αργία | Επίπεδο Επίδρασης | Τι Κλείνει |\n|------------|-------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1 Ιαν | Πρωτοχρονιά | Υψηλό | Όλα |\n| 6 Ιαν | Θεοφάνεια | Μεσαίο | Τράπεζες, γραφεία |\n| 2 Μαρ | Καθαρά Δευτέρα | Υψηλό | Οι περισσότερες επιχειρήσεις |\n| 25 Μαρ | 25η Μαρτίου | Υψηλό | Κυβέρνηση, τράπεζες |\n| 10-13 Απρ | Ορθόδοξο Πάσχα | Πολύ Υψηλό | Όλα για 4 μέρες |\n| 1 Μαϊ | Πρωτομαγιά | Μεσαίο-Υψηλό | Τράπεζες, γραφεία |\n| 1 Ιουν | Αγίου Πνεύματος | Χαμηλό-Μεσαίο | Τράπεζες |\n| 15 Αυγ | Δεκαπενταύγουστος | Πολύ Υψηλό | Οι περισσότερες επιχειρήσεις |\n| 28 Οκτ | ΟΧΙ | Μεσαίο-Υψηλό | Κυβέρνηση, τράπεζες |\n| 25-26 Δεκ | Χριστούγεννα | Υψηλό | Οι περισσότερες επιχειρήσεις |\n\n---\n\n## Σχεδιασμός Ταξιδιών για τις Ελληνικές Αργίες 2026\n\nΠριν κλείσετε οτιδήποτε, ελέγξτε τα δρομολόγια ferry γύρω από τις αργίες—αλλάζουν συνεχώς και συχνά αποσύρονται χωρίς προειδοποίηση. Για τα πασχαλινά ταξίδια συγκεκριμένα, κλείστε 2-3 μήνες νωρίτερα ή αποδεχτείτε ότι θα πληρώσετε αυξημένες τιμές για ό,τι έχει απομείνει. Κατεβάστε ένα ελληνικό ορθόδοξο ημερολόγιο για τις ημερομηνίες ταξιδιού σας ώστε οι θρησκευτικές αργίες να μη σας παραπλανούν. Η ταξιδιωτική ασφάλεια γίνεται απαραίτητη κατά τις περιόδους αργιών όταν οι διαταραχές πολλαπλασιάζονται.\n\nΟι τιμές κυμαίνονται άγρια κατά τις κορυφαίες περιόδους. Αναμένετε αυξήσεις 30-70% για την πασχαλινή εβδομάδα (10-13 Απριλίου), το σαββατοκύριακο 15 Αυγούστου και τα Χριστούγεννα/Πρωτοχρονιά. Νησιά από μέσα Σεπτεμβρίου έως μέσα Οκτωβρίου προσφέρουν την καλύτερη ισορροπία—ο καιρός είναι ακόμα έξοχος, οι τιμές πέφτουν από τις κορυφές του καλοκαιριού και τα πλήθη αραιώνουν. Παραλείψτε την Αθήνα σε ημερομηνίες διαδηλώσεων (1 Μαΐου, 17 Νοεμβρίου, 6 Δεκεμβρίου) εκτός αν ενδιαφέρεστε ειδικά για τις διαδηλώσεις. Πιο σημαντικό, αγκαλιάστε τις τοπικές γιορτές αντί να τις αποφεύγετε. Η διαταραχή είναι πραγματική, αλλά η πολιτιστική απόδοση την αξίζει.\n\n---\n\n## Πότε να Επισκεφθείτε την Ελλάδα το 2026\n\nΤέλη Μαΐου έως αρχές Ιουνίου φέρνει τέλειο καιρό πριν χτυπήσουν οι τιμές αιχμής σεζόν. Τέλη Σεπτεμβρίου έως μέσα Οκτωβρίου προσφέρει ζεστές θάλασσες, φθινοπωρινά χρώματα να ξεκινούν στα βουνά και πραγματικά ήσυχα νησιά. Μέσα Οκτωβρίου έως Νοέμβριο λειτουργεί με θαύμα για εξερεύνηση της ηπειρωτικής—πολιτιστικά μέρη, πεζοπορία, πιο δροσερός καιρός και ηρεμία χαμηλής σεζόν.\n\nΓια ομαλό ταξίδι χωρίς διαταραχές, αποφύγετε την πασχαλινή εβδομάδα (10-13 Απριλίου) εντελώς εκτός αν θέλετε συγκεκριμένα την πολιτιστική εμβύθιση. Το σαββατοκύριακο 15 Αυγούστου συνδυάζει το καλοκαιρινό χάος σε αιχμή με μεγάλη αργία—είναι πραγματικά κατακλυστικό. Η χριστουγεννιάτικη εβδομάδα περιορίζει σημαντικά τις υπηρεσίες.\n\nΟι λάτρεις του πολιτισμού θα πρέπει να στοχεύσουν συγκεκριμένες εκδηλώσεις: περίοδο Καρναβαλιού (Φεβρουάριος-Μάρτιος) στην Πάτρα ή τη Χάνθη, Πάσχα (12 Απριλίου) στην Κέρκυρα ή τη Χίο ή την Ύδρα, 15 Αυγούστου στην Τήνο για την ατμόσφαιρα προσκυνήματος και ημέρα ΟΧΙ (28 Οκτωβρίου) στη Θεσσαλονίκη για τη στρατιωτική παρέλαση.\n\n---\n\n## 🗺️ Εξερευνήστε την Ελλάδα Σαν Ντόπιος\n\nΟ σχεδιασμός γύρω από τις αργίες είναι μόνο η αρχή.
