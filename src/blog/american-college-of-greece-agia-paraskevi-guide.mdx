If you're an international student at **The American College of Greece**, Agia Paraskevi will quickly feel like your everyday base in Athens. It sits northeast of the city center, with a calmer rhythm than downtown but easy access to culture, coastlines, and weekend escapes.

This is the practical version of the neighborhood guide: how to move around, where to eat, where to study, and what to do when you need a break from classes.

## Why Students Like Agia Paraskevi

Agia Paraskevi combines residential comfort with student convenience:

- Tree-lined streets and a generally safe, local feel
- Plenty of cafés and casual food at student-friendly prices
- Easy access to broader Athens via bus, metro connections, and taxis
- Fast routes toward the east coast for beach days

You get a “live like a local” setup without losing access to central Athens.

## Getting Around: Transport & Parking

### Public Transit

Buses are frequent and useful for daily movement inside and around the area. Depending on exactly where you're staying, metro access is usually through nearby Line 3 stations (such as Agia Paraskevi, Nomismatokopio, or Halandri), then onward to central hubs.

For route and schedule updates, check the official Athens transit network:

- [OASA (buses)](https://www.oasa.gr/)
- [STASY (metro)](https://www.stasy.gr/)

### Taxi & Rideshare

Taxis are widely available and generally affordable compared with major U.S. cities. For late-night returns, airport trips, or group rides after class, they’re often the easiest option.

### Parking

If you rent or borrow a car, street parking is possible but tighter in evenings and weekends. Plan extra time near central squares, busy café streets, and campus-adjacent zones.
