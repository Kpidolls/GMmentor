Some Greek holidays close everything—shops, ferries, restaurants. Others bring unmissable celebrations and village festivals. Plan wrong, and you'll hit locked doors on arrival. Plan right, and you'll experience authentic culture most tourists miss. This month-by-month guide shows what actually happens on 2026's major holidays and how to use that knowledge to your advantage.

## January 2026: New Year and Epiphany

### Will New Year's Day (January 1) ruin my plans in Athens?

Yes, if you're not prepared. **January 1 is a national holiday** and almost everything shuts down:

- Banks and shops are closed
- Public transport runs on reduced schedules
- Museums often stay shut
- Many restaurants are fully booked or closed

Locals celebrate at home with family meals and traditional **Vasilopita** (New Year's cake).

**💡 Local tip:** Arrive on December 30 or 31 to enjoy festive energy without the shutdown. Stock up on essentials the day before.

---

### What is Epiphany (January 6), and should I avoid it?

**Epiphany (Theophania)** is a major religious holiday marked by the **Blessing of the Waters** ceremony. Priests throw a cross into the sea, and brave locals dive in to retrieve it.

**What's affected:**
- Banks and public services close
- Tourist areas generally stay open
- Coastal cities and islands attract crowds

**💡 Local tip:** Watch the ceremony in [Nafplio](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RTVhcLFPcRsrvnfZA) or Piraeus for a unique cultural moment. Ferry schedules can be limited, so book early.

## February–March 2026: Carnival Season

### How do Carnival and Clean Monday affect travel?

**Carnival season** fills cities like Patras and Xanthi with parades, costumes, and parties. Roads and buses get crowded.

- Mass picnics and kite flying
