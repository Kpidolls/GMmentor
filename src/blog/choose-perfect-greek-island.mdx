Over 200 inhabited Greek islands exist, and yes, picking "the perfect one" actually does matter—for your specific trip. Here's the thing: Santorini is beautiful and chaotic. Mykonos is glamorous and expensive. Rhodes has history. Crete has everything. Naxos is underrated. Some islands are couples-only, others are family-friendly, still others are for solo travelers who want to disappear.

## Step 1: Define Your Travel Style

Start by thinking about what kind of vacation experience you want. Ask yourself questions like:

- Do I want a peaceful retreat or an energetic party scene?  
- Am I drawn more to beaches, culinary delights or historical sites?
- Do I prefer luxury accommodations or a stay with local charm?  
- Will I rent a car for freedom to explore or rely on public transport?  
- Am I traveling solo, with a partner or with family?

Knowing your priorities will help you pick an island that truly fits your style.
